# JavaScript Data Structures, Algorithms and Design Patterns
My aim is to implement popular data structures, algorithms and design patterns using the JavaScript programming language. I am on a never-ending learning journey and essentially "sharping the saw". I will also endeavor to provide documentation for each data structure, algorithm and design pattern, implement tests and practice using JSDoc.

## Data Structures
A **data structure** is data organisation, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. Specifically, a **data structure** is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Algorithms
An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions which solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

## Design Patterns
In software engineering, a software **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. **Design patterns** are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
